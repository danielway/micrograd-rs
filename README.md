# micrograd-rs

A Rust implementation of [Andrej Karpathy's micrograd engine](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd). Implemented as part of a personal exploration into neural networking with applications like [`danielway/nn-sim`](https://github.com/danielway/nn-sim).

> A tiny scalar-valued autograd engine and a neural net library on top of it with PyTorch-like API
